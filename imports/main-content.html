												Founded in 1968, Intel is one of the largest american multinational manufacturers of a range of advanced internal computer circuitry. Intel has been assisting in this project by providing access to the Intel Smart Citizen API, a multi sensor arduino board that gets the current light, noise and air quality levels from its sensors.

								<h2>Project Background</h2>
								<p>
									Nearly <b>9,500</b>
									people die in London every year due to long term exposure to air pollution. For the past 5 years London has been in breach of the EU NO <sub>2</sub>
									safety limit.
								</p>
								<p>
									Because of this we have been tasked to design a smartwatch app that gets up to date data about the levels of air pollution as well as other forms of pollution so people can make more informed decisions about where in the city they go.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section class="challenges">
								<h2>Challenges</h2>
								<p>
									Upon starting the project, there were some challenges we thought we might face. Maybe our client would not know exactly what they wanted the finished app to do so after every meeting, changing their requirements and deadlines, leaving us without a confirmed set of goals. The chance that one team member does not contribute enough, if at all would make the other memberâ€™s workload, with both the documentation and development of the app, unending. So far we have avoided all these problems.
								</p>
								<p>
									To make the project work well, we both realised some things needed to be done. We needed to have a good relationship and therefore strong communication between ourselves and the clients, with regular correspondence and meetings.. This will help us in fully understanding the requirements and limitations of the project before we even considered delivering them, ensuring that we are not promising a product we cannot produce. Good project management would be required with, when necessary, revisitations and refinements of all aspects of our task. Though we have divided the work between us both, we still collaborate on it. Brainstorming design ideas, finding bugs in code and documentation is a group effort.

									</ul>

								<h2>DataSets Research</h2>
								<p>
									Our intial research revolved around the open source datasets available to use for the app, and we produced the following documentation:
								</p>
								<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9yTj22eCtYQZTxIlQuN0-8bJN5Oz2cTI6RKFpdgIgQ/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>
								<p>
									We only looked into open source datasets available as we wanted to find datasets that were not difficult to access. Another criteria for selection was the relevance of the dataset, with our priorities on detailed Air quality statistics as well as location based data as our smartwatch app will rely on updates when entering a new zones within London.
								</p>
								<p>Our conclusion from this research was three chosen datasets:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										London Air API - Provides Hourly and Weekly detailed updates on air pollution for all zones within London (JSON / XML)
									</li>
									<li>
										Intel Smart Citizen API - Provides Live updates on air, light and noise pollution from a variety of Smart Citizen devices located around London (JSON / XML)
									</li>
									<li>
										Data.Gov.UK - Provides Yearly updates on air and social ( e.g. Crime) pollution for all zones in London XML / PDF / Excel)
									</li>
								</ul>
							</section>
							<section class="p-technologies">
								<h2>Technologies</h2>
								<p>
									The following technologies have been selected by our team to be used for elements of our project: Java for the Smartwatch app and smartphone app programming, Node JS for the backend API, MongoDB for the data storage for the pollution data, Heroku used to host the app.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have selected 3 data sets for our project that will provide us with a variety of different interval updates and detailed information about pollution types. This decision was made as these were the most relevant pollution data and the frequency of updates were spaced out enough for us to have reliable and relevant data for the user to use with a range of historical and live data.
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of hardware, we are aiming the app to be used with android smartphones and android wear smartwatch.Another hardware device being used is the Intel Smart Citizen, an Arduino board that contains many sensors to collect data about air, noise and light pollution. We are using this board as we are able to query the sensor values from all Smart Citizen boards within the London area.

								<h2>Possible Smartwatches</h2>
								<p>
									In our initial requirements meeting with the client, we were asked to look into suitable smartwatches to use as a template for our smartwatch app and that was within budget of the project.

								<p>
									Based on the availability of the researched smartwatches and the prices, we have chosen to use the Sony Smartwatch 3. The large screen size of the smartwatch is beneficial to us as we have the ability to use a much larger area to display visualisations (320 X 320 px), allowing for much more detailed views.

								<h2>Visualisations</h2>

									As part of our intial research, our clients requested that we produce 10 - 15 potential visusalisations that could be implemented with detailed explanation of their workings and how we intend the user to work the interface.

									Below are the intial visualisations that we produced with a brief explanation of how they will be implemented:

									<p>
										As shown in the diagram, our project attempts to collect data from multiple data source to produce a city pollution app for London. This the basic overview of how technologies are used within our project, with a Node JS API being used to query the data sources and saving the queried results into a MongoDB database. The smartphone makes requests and gets responses from the API in JSON/XML format and this is passed onto the smart watch where data is shown in visualisations for the user.

									<h1>Plans for Term 2</h1>
									<p>
										During the course of Term 1, we managed to understand the project requirements and produce a set of potential visualisations for the smartwatch app - finally deciding on a single design that we produced a Proof of Concept for. We have also confirmed with the clients regarding our plans for the technologies that we will use with the project, and they have confirmed our choices.
									</p>
									<p>
										Using the information we have gathered our plan for Term 2 is the following:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Create the NodeJS RESTful API with links to MongoDB using Heroku
										</li>
										<li>
											Develop a schema with guidelines for the combined datasets being fed into our API
										</li>
										<li>
											Retrieve the data from the Data.Gov.UK website using an automated system
										</li>
										<li>
											Produce the Android application that generates requests on behalf of the smartwatch and reads responses to send to the smartwatch
										</li>
										<li>
											Create the Smartwatch visualisation UI as well as the data transmission service for the smartwatch app
										</li>
										<li>
											Implement the testing strategies that we have researched into
										</li>
