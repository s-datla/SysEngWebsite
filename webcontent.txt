Heading: Background
p: Nearly 9,500 people die in London every year due to long term exposure to air pollution. For the past 5 years London has been in breach of the EU NO<sub>2</sub> safety limit. Because of this we have been tasked to design a smartwatch app that gets up to date data about the levels of air pollution as well as other forms of pollution so people can make more informed decisions about where in the city they go. Our clients are Nicolai Marquardt and Steve Houben.

Heading: Brief
p: Our project brief is to design and develop a city pollution visualisation app for smartwatches that allows users to view key pollution statistics about their current location that may assist in deicision making

Heading: System Overview / Project Diagram: (SHOW DIAGRAM)
p: As shown in the diagram, our project attempts to collect data from multiple data source to produce a city pollution app for London
This the basic overview of how technologies are used within our project, with a Node JS API being used to query the data sources and saving the queried results into a MongoDB database. The smartphone makes requests and gets responses from the API in JSON/XML format and this is passed onto the smart watch where data is shown in visualisations for the user.

Heading: Project Diagram Explained: (SHOW DIAGRAM)
p: The following technologies have been selected by our team to be used for elements of our project: Java for the Smartwatch app and smartphone app programming, Node JS for the backend API, MongoDB for the data storage for the pollution data, Heroku used to host the app
We have selected 3 data sets for our project that will provide us with a variety of different interval updates and detailed information about pollution types. This decision was made as these were the most relevant pollution data and the frequency of updates were spaced out enough for us to have reliable and relevant data for the user to use with a range of historical and live data
In terms of hardware, we are aiming the app to be used with android smartphones and android wear smartwatch
Another hardware device being used is the Intel Smart Citizen, an Arduino board that contains many sensors to collect data about air, noise and light pollution. We are using this board as we are able to query the sensor values from all Smart Citizen boards within the London area.

Heading: Data Update Process: (SHOW DIAGRAM)
p: Here is a simple example of what we envision the data update process to be for our app with the interaction between technologies
User enters new zone
Smartphone GPS detects change in location
Data Update Request Sent
JSON request sent with zone information from smartphone
Zone Information Generated
RESTful API queries datasets
Data collated into MongoDB with matching field information
Pollution Data Response
JSON / XML Data sent to Smartphone
Display To User
Smartphone sends smartwatch the response in JSON
Smartwatch then displays visualisation to the user

We need to get started writing the RESTful API and planning on how this should work
