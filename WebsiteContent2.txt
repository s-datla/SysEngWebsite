2.1 : Why is pollution important?

p: Air quality in cities is a constant issue, affecting millions of people worldwide and responsible for many ailments. In London alone, 9,500 people die annually from long-term exposure to air pollution, exceeding expected values by twice the amount. In a recent study undertaken by researchers, two key pollutants were identified as the main offenders:
NO<sub>2</sub> and PM2.5 (fine particulates which are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter).

p: The line graph on the left displays emissions levels for various pollutants for the UK (units are million tonnes). Due to efforts from various UK bodies to curb the levels of emissisons, we can see a gradual decline in pollution levels of major pollutants. However, in certain urban areas there are still times during the year when emissions are present in high quantities. This information is freely available from multiple sources, but not provided in a simple format for the general public to understand and adapt their daily activities to. 

p: There is an opportunity to provide an easy to use application that can achieve this task and assist users in modifying their behavious based on pollution statistics in their current location. For this reason, we have been tasked by the Intel Collaborative Research Institue, Microsoft Research, and UCL Engineering to design and develop such as system.

2.2 : Project Background

Heading : Project Brief

p: Our project brief is to design and develop a city pollution visualisation app for smartwatches that allows users to view key pollution statistics about their current location that may assist in decision making.

Heading : Initial Requirements - MoSCoW

tr: Must

p: Use 3 pollution data sets updated at different rates ie live, daily, yearly
Display data visually on a smartwatch
Have a general view and a detailed view for each type of data
Interact with an android app
Must update as the user moves round the city and periodically or when the user requests a refresh
Have a clear simple UI

tr: Should

p: Have our own database to consolidate all other data sources into
Send notifications to users based on air quality and their quality preferences
Have synchronous and asynchronous connection to database
Store the last set of data offline in the app
Have clearly defined zones for the city

tr: Could

p: Include social data eg twitter posts or facebook etc.
Include traffic data
Allow user to select which information they want to display

tr: Would

p: Extend for use in other cities
Extend to a fully fledged android or web app for visualisations as well
Develop api for our database so others can use the data we have consolidated
Expand the number of data sources we are using

Heading : Clients

tr: Intel Collaborative Research Institute
p: Founded in 1968, Intel is one of the largest american multinational manufacturers of a range of advanced internal computer circuitry. Intel has been assisting in this project by providing access to the Intel Smart Citizen API, a multi sensor arduino board that gets the current light, noise and air quality levels from its sensors.

tr: UCL Engineering
p: We have been partnered with the Physical Computing section of the Computer Science Department in UCL, specifically by Dr Nicolai Marquardt and Steven Houben. They are supervising our project and have provided resources such as the smartwatches and the Intel SmartCitizen board as well as guiding us throughout the development of the project in Term 1.

tr: Microsoft Research
p: Microsoft Research is the research division of Microsoft, aiming to be at the forefront of technology and solve difficult real world problems with state of the art technologies.
